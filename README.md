# Markethics
This is the FBLA project repository of Richard Xu, Andrew Xie, and Jonathan He. We competed in the Computer Game & Simulation Programming event, and we created a stock market game using the Java programming language and BlueJ IDE. The goal of the game is to help players become more acquainted with the trends of the stock market and how business and ethical decisions can affect a company's value.

Source code is provided.

# Installation and How to Run 
As of now, the project runs on Windows (Windows 8 or later), macOS, and Linux systems. We hope to extend support to mobile systems in the future.

If you are familiar with running JAR files, you can skip to Step 2 and run it to start the game directly.

Otherwise:
1. Download the [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/) Java environment app
2. Download the [JAR file](https://github.com/RX7775/Markethics-Nationals/blob/main/Markethics%20Nationals.jar) to a place you can find
3. In BlueJ, go to the top left and click Project -> Open ZIP/JAR... and select the jar file you just downloaded
4. Right click the box named TitlePage -> Compile
5. Right click TitlePage -> void main(String[] args)
6. The game should now be running
7. If you close the game, follow Step 5 to run the game again

# Materials Used
We leveraged various elements (e.g. timer, panels) of the Java Swing library in order to build the graphical user interface (GUI) of our game.

We also utilized open-source fonts provided by Google Fonts (Permanent Marker, Caveat) in order to display our game.
